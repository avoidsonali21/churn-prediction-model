# churn-prediction-model
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict customer churn. The model analyzes various customer attributes and behaviors to identify patterns that indicate a likelihood of churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.
# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and transactional data, the model identifies patterns that indicate the likelihood of a customer leaving. The insights derived from this project can help businesses implement retention strategies and reduce customer attrition.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographic information, subscription details, transaction history, and customer support interactions. It is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding customer behavior through visualization.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized model performance using GridSearchCV.
- **Prediction & Insights:** Identified key factors contributing to customer churn.



## Results & Insights
- **Top Factors Influencing Churn:** Customer tenure, contract type, and monthly charges.
- **Best Performing Model:** Random Forest with 85% accuracy.
- **Business Impact:** Helps businesses identify at-risk customers and take preventive actions.
